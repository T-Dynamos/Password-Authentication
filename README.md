# Password-Authentication
Create a dictionary of usernames with their passwords.
Then you have to ask for user input as the username by using the input function in Python.
Then you have to use the getpass module in Python to ask for user input as the password. Here we are using the getpass module instead of the input function to make sure that the user doesnâ€™t get to see what he/she write in the password field.
